ScanX's project was just a little boring idea I had so people can learn how to make basic cheats easier and learn reverse engineering better (this kind of works like cheat engines value scanner and editor).

This project is auto updating, because it fetches the current addresses automatically in the process.

THIS IS NOT A SCRIPT EXECUTOR AND SHOULD NOT BE USED AS AN EVERYDAY CHEAT!!!!

And another note, this process can crash very easily if you aren't smart with it. You also should have a good pc for it to work better.
